# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

# Introduction

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. They've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping we can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

# Analysis

Analysis was done on SQL and visualized on Power BI. I chose to use SQL for the analysis because With SQL, you can analyze small and big datasets, investigate problems and generate sales reports faster. I uploaded the dataset first on SQL Server where I did all the analysis before visualizing it on Power BI.

# Conclusion
Pizza orders and revenue maintains an upward trajectory from the beginning of the week Sunday and peaks on Friday before it starts dropping, this means most people prefer to eat pizza towards and during the weekend. Most people prefer to have the Pepperoni pizza for lunch on Fridays. It is advisable to make available tables and chairs to be able to accomodate the influx of the weekend, we can also explore the option of delivery services. The Ingrdients for  Pepperoni pizza should be made readily available and in large quantities on or before Fridays. Since more orders are received on Fridays, a discount policy can be introduced every last Friday of the month where a customer gets 1 extra pizza when they buy 3 and above, this will encourage them to buy more.
